# Trend Analysis
Created a Looker Dashboard which shows the Average Device Age by Product Family, Region and Customer for Detailed Analysis for some devices.


This Data will show the Average Age of the Device by Customer/Product Family/Region for each quarters.

Using the Trend of the Data we can also find out if the device is New or Established Product.


Note: As it was any official data,I could manage only to take screen shots of the dashboard.
